             <p>Watercolor or watercolour also aquarelle is a painting method in which the paints are made of pigments suspended in a water-based solution. 
	     Watercolor refers to both the medium and the resulting artwork. 
	     Aquarelles painted with water-soluble colored ink instead of modern water colors are called "aquarellum atramento" by experts. 
	     However, this term has now tended to pass out of use.
	     Watercolor painting is extremely old, dating perhaps to the cave paintings of paleolithic Europe,
	     and has been used for manuscript illustration since at least Egyptian times but especially in the European Middle Ages. 
	     However, its continuous history as an art medium begins with the Renaissance.</P>
