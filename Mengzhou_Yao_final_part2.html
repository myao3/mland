  <h1>Final Project Part 2</h1>
  <P>1. What was your previous knowledge of HTML/CSS/Javascript?</P>
  <p>I did not any knowledge of HTML/CSS/Javascript before this class. </P>
  <p>2. Did you use a template or did you build your portfolio from scratch?</P>
  <p>I used the template from module 04 and built my portfolio from scratch. It is a great practice for me. </p>
  <p>3. What was the most challenging part of your portfolio (ie, the template, artifacts, CSS, etc.)</p>
  <p>The most challenging part was the artifacts. I will spend more time working on the Artifacts than the assignments. 
  I can reinforce my knowledge with the Artifacts. </p>
  <p>4. How taking this class changed your view on Web Development?</p>
  <p>Before taking this class, I thought that coding is difficult to learn and dull. 
  The coding is fun and it can bring my imagination and creativity to my website by HTML, CSS, javascript elements. 
  Sometimes my website has a bug or is missing the ending tag, 
  but it is fun for me to figure out the problem and find the solution. </p>
  <p>5. What would you recommend to future students taking this class?</p>
  <p>At the end of the class, you will have a website developed by you. 
  You will be proud of yourself that you have learned HTML/CSS/Javascript. 
  It will be a great experience and I recommend the future students to take this class. </p>
